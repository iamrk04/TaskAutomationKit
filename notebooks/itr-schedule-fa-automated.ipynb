    "Whenever the above cell fails, firstly you **must make sure that the page is back to the same state** as [mentioned earlier](../images/schedule-fa-pre-requisite.png) and then you should do the following in order until the issue is resolved:\n",
    "- The cell will print the last row number that was successful. You can set the value of `idx_start` to the last succesful row number + 1 and run the cell again. This will start entering data from the row where it failed.\n",
    "- If you see the same error again, identify the line where it fails. Put a `time.sleep(2)` before the failed line if it's not already there or try increasing the value of `time.sleep()` and run the cell again.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If you can't resolve the error, feel free to create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iamrk04/TaskAutomationKit/issues). Make sure to include the error message with the entire stacktrace."
